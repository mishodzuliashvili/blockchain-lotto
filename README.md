# Blottery 🎟️

Blottery is a decentralized lottery platform built on the Polygon network, allowing users to participate in lottery games using their MetaMask wallet. Players can buy tickets for various games and potentially win rewards once a set amount of money is collected. I have been mostly working on the solidity side in this project!

## Features 🌟
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the Polygon network.
- **Games**:
  - **Classical Lotto**: Pick 6 numbers and test your luck! 🎰
  - **Dice Roll**: Roll the dice and win! 🎲
  - **Coin Flip**: Heads or tails – simple but fun! 🪙
- **Rewards**: When enough money is collected, a countdown starts, and winners are rewarded based on game results.
- **Blockchain**: Solidity contracts handle game logic and ticket purchasing. Currently using a pseudorandom number generator, but we are integrating Chainlink's verifiable random functions (VRF) for enhanced randomness.

## How It Works 🔧
1. **Connect Wallet**: Players connect their MetaMask wallet on the Polygon network.
2. **Buy Tickets**: Choose a game and purchase tickets using cryptocurrency.
3. **Win Rewards**: After enough tickets are sold, the countdown begins, and winners are selected.

## Technologies Used 🚀
- **Solidity**: Smart contracts for managing game logic and ticket purchases.
- **Polygon Network**: Fast and low-cost transactions.
- **MetaMask**: Wallet integration for seamless user experience.
- **Chainlink VRF** *(in progress)*: For true randomness in game results.

## How to Play 🕹️
1. Connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Select a game (Lotto, Dice Roll, Coin Flip).
3. Purchase tickets.
4. Wait for the countdown and see if you’ve won!

## Future Plans 🔮
- **Chainlink VRF** integration for secure and provably fair random number generation.
